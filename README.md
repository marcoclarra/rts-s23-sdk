# Raspberry Pi Pico SDK

The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK (henceforth the SDK) provides the headers, libraries and build system
necessary to write programs for the RP2040-based devices such as the Raspberry Pi Pico
in C, C++ or assembly language.

The SDK is designed to provide an API and programming environment that is familiar both to non-embedded C developers and embedded C developers alike.
A single program runs on the device at a time and starts with a conventional `main()` method. Standard C/C++ libraries are supported along with
C level libraries/APIs for accessing all of the RP2040's hardware include PIO (Programmable IO).
